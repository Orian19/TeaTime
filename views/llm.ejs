    <h1>LLM Generated Code</h1>
    <pre>
        <h2>Use of Large Language Models (LLM) in Our Project</h2>
        <p>In developing TeaTime, we used Large Language Models (LLM) to accelerate our development process and enhance the quality of our code. 
We primarily used LLM to generate initial structures for our codebase, providing us with a solid foundation to build upon. 
This included scaffolding for our Express.js server, basic route structures, and template layouts for our EJS views. 
Additionally, we utilized LLM to generate sample content, such as product descriptions for our teas and initial customer reviews. 
However, it's important to note that we didn't simply copy and paste this generated code. Instead, we carefully reviewed, modified, 
and expanded upon the LLM-generated content to ensure it met our specific needs and maintained high quality standards. 
We customized the server logic, fine-tuned the routing, and significantly enhanced the frontend interactions. 
The product descriptions and reviews were edited for authenticity and to align with our brand voice. 
This approach allowed us to combine the efficiency of AI-assisted coding with our own creativity and problem-solving skills, 
resulting in a unique and robust e-commerce platform.</p>
