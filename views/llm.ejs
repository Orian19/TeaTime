    <h1>LLM Generated Code</h1>
    <pre>
        <h2>Use of Large Language Models (LLM) in Our Project</h2>
        <p>In developing TeaTime, we used Large Language Models (LLM) to accelerate our development process and debug our code when encountering difficult bugs.
We primarily used LLM to generate initial structures for our codebase, providing us with a solid base point to start building on.
This included basic route structures, and template layouts for our EJS views. 
Additionally, we utilized LLM to help us with css, as well as generate sample content, such as product descriptions for our teas and initial customer reviews. 
However, it's important to note that we didn't copy and paste this generated code. Instead, we carefully reviewed, modified,
and expanded the LLM-generated content to ensure it met our specific needs and maintained high quality standards as well as meeting the project's requirements. </p>
